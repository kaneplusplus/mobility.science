# Dynamic Social Vulnerability Index (DSVI)

The Dynamic Social Vulnerability Index (DSVI) is a comprehensive metric designed to assess and quantify the social vulnerability of populations in a changing environment. Unlike static vulnerability indices, the DSVI incorporates temporal dynamics, recognizing that vulnerability is not fixed but evolves over time due to various socio-economic, environmental, and political factors.

## Key Components

The DSVI typically includes several dimensions:

- **Socioeconomic Factors**: Income levels, education, employment status, and access to resources.
- **Demographic Characteristics**: Age, gender, ethnicity, and population density.
- **Health and Well-being**: Access to healthcare, prevalence of chronic illnesses, and mental health indicators.
- **Infrastructure and Connectivity**: Transportation networks, communication systems, and utility access.
- **Environmental Exposure**: Proximity to hazards, climate change impacts, and natural disaster risks.

## Applications in Mobility Science

In the context of human mobility, the DSVI helps in understanding how vulnerable populations respond to disruptions. For instance:

- During natural disasters, areas with high DSVI may experience prolonged recovery times.
- Migration patterns can be influenced by changing vulnerability levels in origin and destination regions.
- Policy interventions can be targeted to reduce dynamic vulnerabilities over time.

## Methodology

The DSVI is calculated using a combination of geospatial data, time-series analysis, and machine learning techniques to model vulnerability trajectories. It often integrates data from censuses, satellite imagery, and real-time sensors.

For more detailed research and data, refer to ongoing studies in social vulnerability and mobility science.
